/**
 * restores OpcodeStack Item's userValues when a ternary is processed. This
 * class is required because Findbugs has a bug whereby it strips the user value
 * field from all OpcodeStack items when a GOTO is processed when items are on
 * the stack. Normally this is not the case, but in the case of ternary handling
 * there may be N items on the stack before what the ternary pushes. Now clearly
 * the uservalue should be stripped for items pushed on by both branches of the
 * ternary, but items that were on the stack before the ternary was executed
 * should be left alone. This is currently not happening in findbugs. So this
 * class saves off user values across a GOTO involved with a ternary and
 * restores them appropriately.
